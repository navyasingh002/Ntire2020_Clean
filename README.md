Steps to generate hyperspectral images given rgb images..

  - put the test images (rgb) in ./dataset/NTIRE2020_Test_Clean/ or ./dataset/NTIRE2020_Test_RealWorld/ as per the track.
  - download [rgb2hyperspectral models](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rJwAChi7Wdl1YZrXHegM9qM2i481UCFk) and put them in ./models_rgb2hs/track_name. (track_name is any arbitary folder name which we need to set in the test script.)
  - run the [ntire_test.py](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rJwAChi7Wdl1YZrXHegM9qM2i481UCFk) script
  - The results will be generated in ./Validation_results/track_name/model_name
